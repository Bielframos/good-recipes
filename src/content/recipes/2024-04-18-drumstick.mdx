# Drumstick

"Coxinha" as Brazilians know it is a beloved Brazilian snack that consists of shredded chicken wrapped in dough, shaped like a teardrop or coxinha, breaded and fried until perfectly golden.

<PreparationTime total="1 hour 30 minutes" preparation="1 hour" cooking="30 minutes" />

## Ingredients

- 2 cups shredded chicken
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup chicken broth
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup breadcrumbs
- Oil for frying

## Preparation

1. In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion and minced garlic, sauté until softened.
2. Add shredded chicken to the skillet, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine.
3. Pour in chicken broth, cover, and let simmer for 15-20 minutes until the chicken is tender and the liquid is reduced. Remove from heat and let cool.
4. In a separate saucepan, bring chicken broth, butter, and salt to a boil. Reduce heat to low and gradually add flour, stirring constantly until a dough forms.
5. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Let it cool for a few minutes.
6. Take a portion of the dough and flatten it in your hand. Place a spoonful of the chicken filling in the center and shape the dough around the filling, forming a teardrop or drumstick shape.
7. Dip each coxinha in breadcrumbs until fully coated.
8. Heat oil in a deep fryer or heavy-bottomed pot to 350°F. Fry the coxinhas in batches until golden brown and crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels.
9. Serve hot and enjoy!
