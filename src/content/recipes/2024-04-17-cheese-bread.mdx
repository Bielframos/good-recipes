# Cheese Bread

Cheese bread, also known as "pão de queijo" in Portuguese, is a popular Brazilian snack made with tapioca flour and cheese, resulting in a soft, chewy, and cheesy bread roll.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups tapioca flour
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup shredded cheese (traditionally Brazilian Minas cheese, but any cheese like cheddar or mozzarella works well)

7. Using your hands, shape the dough into small balls, about 1 to 2 inches in diameter, and place them on the prepared baking sheet.
