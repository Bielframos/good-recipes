## Overview

### The challenge and the solution

This is a beginner level challenge, which does not offer many challenges. However, I decided to develop it using the Astro framework, a framework that I had never used before.

I challenged myself to develop with the new framework because I imagined that the site's proposal calls for a framework that has content as a central element.

To implement the solution I used resources such as Astro's content collection and page integration from MDX files.

I respected the chromatic and typographic standard provided by the challenge, but I took the freedom to improve the UX and a little of the design, based on my personal taste and professional experience.
